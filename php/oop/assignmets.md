> Below scenario has shared to next 3 assignments in 3 different levels

Create a Post class, Each post has title, content, and author. Every post has many comments and we should be able to add comments to each post. You may implement the assignment in 3 levels of complexity:

- **Level I** `*`
    - Each comment is a string
    - Author is a string
- **Level II** `**`
    - Each comment is an object contains of these properties:
        - user [string]
        - content [string]
        - submitedAt [DateTimeImmutable]
    - The author is a valid User object you created in the first assignment
    - There is a functionality to remove comments with an identifier
- **Level III** `***`
    - Each comment has likes/dislikes, It's posible to like/dislike comments
    - A post can be archived
    - Assign an identifier to each post
    - Create a PostRepository in order to create/update/remove/find/sort posts
