"""
1 - Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes.
2 - Create a MiniBus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. Give the capacity argument of MiniBus.seating_capacity() a default value of 20.
4 - Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
3 - Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. Every Vehicle should be white.
Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
